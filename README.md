## Setup the environment

A requirement for this workshop is to have the OpenJDK and maven installed. In ubuntu/debian Linux (:heart: WSL included) you can install typing:

```bash 
# this install all necessary for working with this project 
> sudo apt-get install openjdk-16-jdk maven
```


## Building and executing the solution locally

You can clean and install dependencies doing

```bash
# before launch you should clean and install packages
> ./mvnw clean
> ./mvnw install
```
 You can also execute the application at command line and open a browser at port 8080

```bash 
# with this command you launch the api listening at http://localhost:8080/greeting
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> ./mvnw test
```

Also you can execute all the solution in IntelliJ Idea
